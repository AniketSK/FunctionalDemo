# FunctionalDemo
Demonstrating some functional programming with kotlin for a talk, see the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AenCn5Jbkh0) and updated slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FGt75TfqyUIGXXPfLYAg9zOd1YegPHR6BPgNiIzIP7o/edit#slide=id.gc6f83aa91_0_56)

It's best to navigate this repository by either:
1. Looking at the [tests](https://github.com/AniketSK/FunctionalDemo/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/aniketkadam/functionaldemo/FunctionalOperatorsImplementationKtTest.kt
) and going to what you need from there.
2. Looking at the implementations of the functions themselves which are all at [this](https://github.com/AniketSK/FunctionalDemo/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/aniketkadam/functionaldemo) package.
If you're looking for the Lemonade example, since this talk was originally for an Indian audience, you'll find it under the name [Nimbu Paani](https://github.com/AniketSK/FunctionalDemo/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/aniketkadam/functionaldemo/NimbuPaani.kt) which is Hindi for Lemonade.
